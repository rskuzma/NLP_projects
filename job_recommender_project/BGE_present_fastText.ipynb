    "- Made by facebook <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText>\n",
    "- Treats each word as the aggregation of its subwords. \n",
    "    - Subwords are character n-grams of the word. (e.g. army --> a, r, m, y, ar, rm, my, arm, rmy,\n",
    "- Pros:\n",
    "    - Much better thahn Word2Vec on syntactic tasks, especially with small training corpus\n",
    "    - fastText can be used to obtain vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words\n",
    "- Cons\n",
    "    - Slightly worse than Word2Vec semantic tasks\n",
    "    - Slower training time than Word2Vec\n",
